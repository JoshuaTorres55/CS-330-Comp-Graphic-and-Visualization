## Reflection

Working on this 3D scene project taught me a lot about how I approach designing and developing software. I started by focusing on planning out the layout of my 3D world and making sure I understood how each object, texture, and light source fit together to create a complete scene. I learned how important it is to balance creativity with structure. Setting up the camera, materials, and lighting required patience and problem solving, especially when I ran into issues like misaligned objects or inconsistent shading. Those moments helped me become more organized and thoughtful about my design process. I started seeing design as more than just how something looks—it’s also about how every detail supports the bigger goal of creating something functional and visually clear.

Throughout development, I had to keep refining my approach as I worked through each milestone. Iteration played a huge role since I often had to go back, test, adjust, and rebuild parts of the scene to get the results I wanted. I also got more comfortable using OpenGL and GLSL while managing files and understanding how each part of the code connected to the visuals I was building. This experience showed me how much computer science supports creativity through logic and structure. The skills I gained in computational graphics—especially in rendering, lighting, and object transformations will carry over into my future studies and career, whether I’m working on software, visual simulations, or user experience design. It gave me confidence that I can combine technical skill with design thinking to bring ideas to life.  

## Repository Contents

- **3D Scene ZIP Folder:** Contains the final 3D scene demonstrating my ability to create and structure a complete 3D environment.  
- **Design Decisions Document:** Explains the reasoning behind the design choices, development strategies, and overall creative direction of my project.  
  
## Notes

This repository serves as my final submission for CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization. It reflects the design and development process I followed to build my 3D project and highlights the technical and creative skills I developed throughout the course.
